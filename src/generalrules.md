# General Rules

---
**Level 1** topics like [Zero Knolwdge Proofs](./ZKP.md) must have:

- Curated Resources
- Articles
- Lecture Series
- Protocols

They may or may not also include:

- Hands-On
- Mathematics
- Any other **Level 1** Related Topic

---
If a **Level 2** Topic (ex: [Articles](./introzkp.md)) has Sub-Topics (**Level 3**s) it must have a Table of contents of its included topics, if not (ex: [Lecture Series](./zkpseries.md)) it may have its contents displayed on it

---
The **Articles** section of any **level 1** should preferably be broken down to an **Introductory** vs. other relative topics, and the **Introductory** should preferably be broken down by beginner to advanced
