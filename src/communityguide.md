# Community Guidelines

Welcome to Ingopedia!

This is a community-driven effort to compile a comprehensive collection of resources and information related to Zero Knowledge Proofs. Our goal is to provide a one-stop-shop for anyone interested in learning about ZKPs, from beginners to experts.

We invite the community to help us keep Ingopedia up-to-date and relevant. If you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to submit them through the appropriate channels. We believe that the power of the community lies in collaboration and sharing knowledge, so we encourage everyone to get involved.

To keep this book organized, we ask that you use the designated sections for your contributions. If you have a new resource to share, please add it to the appropriate section. If you are unsure where to add your contribution, feel free to reach out to the moderators for guidance.

Thank you for being a part of our ZKP community and helping us build a valuable resource for all.
